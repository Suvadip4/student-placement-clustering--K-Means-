# Student Placement_Clustering
# Objective
The primary objective of this project is to apply unsupervised machine learning
(clustering) techniques to group students based on their academic and skill-based
attributes, in order to:
• Assess employability readiness of students.
• Identify patterns and similarities among students based on performance metrics.
• Classify students into meaningful groups such as High, Medium, and Low
placement potential without relying on labeled data.
• Assist educational institutions and placement cells in providing targeted training
and support to specific student groups.
By leveraging K-Means clustering, the project helps in visualizing and understanding
student readiness for placement and provides a data-driven approach to improve
placement outcomes.
